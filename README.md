## Vision
  This project aims to provide Red Moon's students with free and limitless access to code screens. Ideally, we would like to offer code screens for all major programming languages, although this may necessitate separate projects for each language, pending further evaluation.

The code screen itself would resemble a sandbox environment, featuring challenge instructions on the left side of the page, a code window on the right side, and a console for viewing logs, warnings, and error messages. This setup closely resembles platforms such as freecodecamp.org, leetcode.com, and various other code challenge platforms available today.
