# redmoon-code-screen

Code screen software for Red Moon Software Apprenticeship Program

## Project vision

This project is intended to serve as a way for Red Moon to give its students access to free and unlimited code screens.

Ideally, code screens could be done in all major programming languages, but this may require a separate project for each language (to be determined).

The code screen would be a sandbox environment with the challenge instructions on the left side of the page, a code window on the right side of the page, and a console to see logs/warnings, and error messages. Very similar to freecodecamp.org, leetcode.com, and every other code challenge platform out there.

A "Submit" button would

1. run tests against the user's code
2. let the user know what tests they did/didn't pass
3. allow the user to enter their email address so that they can email the challenge prompt, their code and results to themself
